Data types:
*  byte   - scalar 8-bit integer.
   int    - scalar 16-bit integer.
   double - scalar double precision float.
   string - dynamic length collection of characters.

   Boolean results may be derived from any value, with 0, 0.0 and
   "" being false and all other values being true.

Operators in order of descending precendence:
   () grouping

*  [] indexing NOT DONE

   !  logical NOT
   ~  bitwise NOT
   -  unary minus = negation

   *  multiplication
   /  division
   %  modulus

   +  addition
   -  subtraction

   << left shift
   >> right shift

   <  less than
   <= less than or equal to
   == equal to
   >  greater than
   >= greater than or equal to
   != not equal to

   &  bitwise AND
   ^  bitwise XOR

   |  bitwise OR

   && logical AND

   || logical OR

   ?: conditional

MS-specific functions:

   itable(val, "filename") - Inverse table lookup.  Given a value,
      it returns the index of the table value nearest that value.

   table(idx, "filename") - Causes the table to be read on the first
      invocation.  Indexes into the table and returns the value
      contained at the specified location.  Table files may contain
      an arbitrary number of 16-bit signed or unsigned quantities.

   tempCvt(x) - Converts Fahrenheit temperature to user-selected
      units.  Does nothing if temperature is set to F.

   vexInterp(rpm, load, page, "file.vex") - Performs interpolation
      of a vex file using the same algorithm as is used in MS-I and
      MS-II code.

NOT DONE:
   type linInterp(Xi, X0,Y0, X1,Y1) - Returns a value with the
      same type as Xi interpolated from the given values.  If Xi
      < X0, then Y0 is returned; if Xi > X1, then Y1 is returned
      (i.e., no extrapolation is done).

   int    int(value)  - Coerces the argument to the specified type.
   byte   byte(value)
   double double(value)
