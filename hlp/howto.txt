1) In resource.h, find IDD_XXX for dialog for which you want to add
   a help file.

2) Create a line in the [MAP] section of megatune.hpj that
   looks like:

      IDH_XXX id=IDD_XXX+0x20000

3) Add an entry in megatune.cnt that refers to IDH_XXX.

4) Use "template.rtf" to create an rtf file with a footnote containing
   #IDH_XXX.

5) Edit megatune.hpj in the [FILES] section to include your new rtf
   file.

6) Edit megatune.cnt to add a reference to IDH_XXX so that it has some
   structure in the index.  (This is not strictly necessary, since the
   IDH up in step 2 associates the F1 key to the file, but do it anyway.)
